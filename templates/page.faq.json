Also, you may want to avoid activities where your hands get extra dirty, as they can cause build-up on the jewelry (although it can usually be removed easily). This may include activities such as gardening, working with clay, cooking, or using lotion\/oils. Please use extra caution with softer stones such as pearls, turquoise, and opals.<\/p><p>In order to avoid tarnishing, it is important to remove any item that is Gold-Dipped Silver before getting it wet or using lotions and perfumes.<\/p>",
